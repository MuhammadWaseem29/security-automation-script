# Security Automation Script

This script automates security testing using Nmap, Nikto, WPScan, SQLMap, and Dirb for comprehensive vulnerability assessment of web applications.

## Installation

### Tools Required

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

1. **Nmap**:
   - [Download and Installation Guide](https://nmap.org/download.html)

2. **Nikto**:
   - [Download and Installation Guide](https://cirt.net/Nikto2)

3. **WPScan**:
   - [Download and Installation Guide](https://wpscan.com/)

4. **SQLMap**:
   - [Download and Installation Guide](http://sqlmap.org/)

5. **Dirb**:
   - [Download and Installation Guide](https://tools.kali.org/web-applications/dirb)

### Steps to Install Tools

#### Nmap

- Visit [Nmap Download Page](https://nmap.org/download.html) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

#### Nikto

- Visit the [Nikto GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sullo/nikto) for installation instructions.

#### WPScan

- Install WPScan using RubyGems:
  ```bash
  gem install wpscan
  ```

#### SQLMap

- Clone the SQLMap repository from GitHub:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git
  cd sqlmap
  ```
  Follow the additional installation instructions provided in the `README.md` file of the SQLMap repository.

#### Dirb

- Install Dirb using package manager (e.g., apt-get):
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install dirb
  ```

## Usage

Replace placeholders `<target_ip>` and `<target_url>` with actual target details before running the script.

```bash
nmap -sV -A -p- --script vuln <target_ip>
nikto -h <target_url> -Tuning 9 -maxtime 2h
wpscan --url <target_url> --enumerate ap,at,tt,cb,dbe,u,m --random-user-agent
sqlmap -u <target_url> --dbs --risk=3 --level=5 --tamper=space2comment,charencode --batch --random-agent --threads=10
dirb <target_url> -X .php,.asp,.aspx,.jsp,.html,.js
```

## Script Explanation

- **Nmap**: Performs service version detection and vulnerability scanning.
- **Nikto**: Executes comprehensive vulnerability checks.
- **WPScan**: Enumerates WordPress plugins, themes, and users.
- **SQLMap**: Conducts SQL injection tests.
- **Dirb**: Brute-forces directories to find hidden files.

## Examples

```bash
# Example command to scan an IP address
nmap -sV -A -p- --script vuln 192.168.1.1

# Example command to scan a URL
nikto -h https://example.com -Tuning 9 -maxtime 2h
```

### Explanation

- **Installation Section:** This section now includes detailed steps for installing each required tool (`Nmap`, `Nikto`, `WPScan`, `SQLMap`, `Dirb`).
- **Links:** Each tool has a direct link to its official download or installation guide, ensuring users can easily access the necessary resources.
- **Commands:** For tools like `WPScan` and `Dirb` that require specific installation commands, those commands are included to facilitate installation.
- **Usage Section:** It remains unchanged, focusing on how to use your automation script after all required tools are installed.

By providing clear and concise installation instructions, you enhance the usability of your script and ensure users can quickly get started with security testing using your automation setup.
# Security Automation Script

This script automates several security testing tools for comprehensive vulnerability assessment of web applications.

### Steps:

1. **Nmap Scan:**
   ```bash
   nmap -sV -A -p- --script vuln <target_ip>

Replace <target_ip> with the IP address of the target you want to scan.
Performs a service version detection and vulnerability scan using Nmap.
Nikto Scan:

bash
Copy code
nikto -h <target_url> -Tuning 9 -maxtime 2h
Replace <target_url> with the URL of the target you want to scan.
Executes Nikto with aggressive tuning and a maximum runtime of 2 hours for detailed vulnerability checks.
WPScan:

bash
Copy code
wpscan --url <target_url> --enumerate ap,at,tt,cb,dbe,u,m --random-user-agent
Replace <target_url> with the URL of the target WordPress site.
Performs enumeration of plugins, themes, users, and more using WPScan with randomized user-agent.
SQLMap:

bash
Copy code
sqlmap -u <target_url> --dbs --risk=3 --level=5 --tamper=space2comment,charencode --batch --random-agent --threads=10
Replace <target_url> with the URL vulnerable to SQL injection.
Conducts SQLMap with high risk and level settings, tampering options, and multi-threaded execution.
Dirb (Directory Brute-force):

bash
Copy code
dirb <target_url> -X .php,.asp,.aspx,.jsp,.html,.js
Replace <target_url> with the base URL to be bruteforced.
Utilizes Dirb to discover hidden files and directories with specified extensions.
Instructions:
Ensure you have the necessary tools (nmap, nikto, wpscan, sqlmap, dirb) installed and properly configured on your system.
Replace placeholders (<target_ip>, <target_url>) with actual target details before running each command.
Run these commands sequentially in a terminal or command prompt for thorough security testing of web applications.
